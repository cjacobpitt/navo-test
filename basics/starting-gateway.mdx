When opening Gateway for the first time, you need to enter a server, username, and password. If your organization uses OpenID Connect, you only need to enter a server and username to be redirected to the single sign-on page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Step">
    Open the Gateway application by one of the following methods:

    - Double-click the Gateway icon on the desktop.
    - Click the **Start** menu, and click the Gateway icon.
    - Click the **Start** menu, search for Gateway in the Windows search box, and click the Gateway application in the results.

    The Gateway application opens and displays the login page.

    In the **Server** field, enter the URL of the Gateway project. If the server does not show in the pull-down list, type the full URL, including the port number where necessary.

    Do one of the following based on the login process:

    - **User and Password**—Enter your username in the first box and your password in the second box.
    - **OpenID Connect**—Select **Login**. You are redirected via a browser to the site where you enter your username and password.
    - **User**—Select **Login**. If redirected via a browser, enter your username and password on the site. If an error returns, return to the DiveTab application to enter your username and password.
  </Step>

    Click Login.

    Gateway synchronizes data in your Gateway instance with data on the DiveLine server.
